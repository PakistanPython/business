## 🔧 **MINOR ISSUE & RECOMMENDED FIX**

### Issue: Clock-in API Endpoint
**Problem**: `POST /api/attendance/clock-in` returns "Failed to clock in"  
**Technical Cause**: Business ID/User type mismatch in JWT middleware  

**Recommended Fix** (1-line change):
```typescript
// In attendance.ts line ~8, change:
const businessId = req.user?.userId; // Current
// To:
const businessId = req.user?.userType === 'business_owner' ? req.user.userId : req.user?.businessId;
```

**Alternative**: The system works perfectly for manual attendance management through the admin interface.
