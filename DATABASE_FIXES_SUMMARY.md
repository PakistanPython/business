# Database Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Payslip Generation Error
**Error**: `SQLITE_ERROR: no such column: p.user_id`

**Root Cause**: 
- The payslip generation query in `backend/src/routes/payroll.ts` was using `p.user_id` to join the payroll table with the users table
- However, the payroll table uses `business_id` (not `user_id`) to reference the business owner in the users table

**Fix Applied**:
```sql
-- Before (incorrect):
JOIN users u ON p.user_id = u.id
WHERE p.id = ? AND p.user_id = ?

-- After (correct):
JOIN users u ON p.business_id = u.id  
WHERE p.id = ? AND p.business_id = ?
```

**Files Modified**:
- `/backend/src/routes/payroll.ts` (lines 199-200)

### 2. Income Update Error
**Error**: `SQLITE_ERROR: cannot UPDATE generated column "amount_remaining"`

**Root Cause**:
- The development server was running `server_sqlite.ts` which imports `income_sqlite.ts`
- The `income_sqlite.ts` file had a query that tried to explicitly update `amount_remaining` in the charity table
- Since `amount_remaining` is a generated column (calculated as `amount_required - amount_paid`), it cannot be updated directly

**Fix Applied**:
```sql
-- Before (incorrect):
UPDATE charity SET amount_required = ?, amount_remaining = amount_required - amount_paid, updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE income_id = ? AND user_id = ?

-- After (correct):
UPDATE charity SET amount_required = ?, updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE income_id = ? AND user_id = ?
```

**Files Modified**:
- `/backend/src/routes/income_sqlite.ts` (line 268)

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Context
- **Payroll Table**: Uses `business_id` to link to the users table (business owner)
- **Charity Table**: Has `amount_remaining` as a generated column: `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (amount_required - amount_paid) STORED`

### Development vs Production
- Development server (`npm run dev`) uses `server_sqlite.ts` which imports SQLite-specific route files
- Production server uses `server.ts` which imports standard route files
- This is why the income update error only occurred in development mode

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Backend builds successfully without TypeScript errors
2. ✅ Backend development server starts on port 5000
3. ✅ Frontend development server starts on port 5174
4. ✅ No database connection errors in logs
5. ✅ Generated columns work correctly without explicit updates

## Current Status

Both servers are running successfully:
- **Backend**: http://localhost:5000 (SQLite development mode)
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5174

All database operations should now work correctly:
- Payslip generation will work with proper table joins
- Income updates will work without trying to modify generated columns
- Charity calculations will be handled automatically by generated columns

## Next Steps for Testing

Users should test:
1. Generate a payslip from the Payroll page
2. Update an income record with different charity percentages
3. Verify all currency displays are in PKR
4. Check that dashboard charts display data correctly
5. Test charity and loan payment history views
6. Test account transfers between accounts
