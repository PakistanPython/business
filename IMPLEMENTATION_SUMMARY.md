# Business Management System - Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed and Features Implemented

### 1. Charity Percentage Deduction Issue ✅

**Problem:** When adding income, charity percentage was not being properly calculated and saved to the charity table.

**Solution:**

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `UserRedirectRoute.tsx` with more robust redirect logic
- Standardized user type property naming (`userType` → `user_type`) across frontend
- Modified route handling to ensure employees stay on `/employee-portal`
- Added debugging console logs for troubleshooting
